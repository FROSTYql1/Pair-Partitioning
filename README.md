# Pair-Partitioning
Given a set of 2n Letters (number of letters is even) I have written an algorithm in c# which will partition this set into all possible pairs size 2. For example:  List a = (A, B, C, D)  which will produce the output:  (((A, B),(C,D)), ((A, C),(B, D)), ((A,D),(B, C)))  And for An example such as:  List a = (A, B, C, D, E, F)  Which will produce a 3 Dimensional List:  (((A, B),(C,D),(E, F)) ((A, B),(C,E),(D, F)).....So on)
